# Docker Fundamentals

## Image
Blueprint used to create containers.

## Container
Running instance of an image.

## Dockerfile
Instruction file used to build an image.
Concept: A Dockerfile is Infrastructure as Code.

## FROM
Base image.

## WORKDIR
Working directory inside the container.

## COPY
Copies files from local machine to image.

## RUN
Executes commands during image build.

## CMD
Default command executed when the container starts.

## EXPOSE
Documents the port the application listens on. It does not publish the port.


# Sprint 2 - Running Containers

## Concepts Learned

* Difference between a Docker Image and a Docker Container.
* A single Docker Image can create multiple independent containers.
* `docker run` creates and starts a new container from an image.
* `--name` assigns a readable name to a container.
* `-p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT` maps a host port to a container port.
* `EXPOSE` only documents the application's listening port; it does not publish the port.
* Applications inside Docker should listen on `0.0.0.0`, not `127.0.0.1`, to allow external access through Docker networking.

## Problem Encountered

* Flask application crashed immediately after the container started.

## Root Cause

* Docker successfully created and started the container.
* The Flask application failed because the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable was not available inside the container.

## Important Takeaway

* Docker and the application are separate responsibilities.
* A container can fail because of the application, not because Docker is broken.
* Always diagnose the problem before modifying code or configuration.


# Sprint 3 - Container Lifecycle & Debugging

## Concepts Learned

* A Docker Image is different from a Docker Container.
* A container has a lifecycle: Created → Running → Exited → Removed.
* `docker run` creates a new container from an image.
* `docker start` starts an existing stopped container.
* `docker stop` stops a running container.
* `docker rm` permanently removes a container but does not delete the image.
* `docker ps` shows only running containers.
* `docker ps -a` shows all containers including exited ones.
* `docker logs` displays the application's stdout and stderr output from inside the container.
* `docker inspect` provides detailed metadata about the container.

## Problem Encountered

* Flask container exited immediately after startup.

## Root Cause

* Docker successfully created and started the container.
* The Flask application failed because the required `DATABASE_URL` environment variable was not available.

## Debugging Workflow

1. Check running containers using `docker ps`.
2. Check all containers using `docker ps -a`.
3. Read application logs using `docker logs`.
4. Inspect container configuration using `docker inspect`.
5. Identify whether the problem belongs to Docker or the application.

## Important Takeaway

* Docker's responsibility ends after starting the container.
* If the application crashes, investigate the application before changing Docker.
* Always debug methodically instead of making random changes.


# Sprint 4 - Application Configuration & Environment Variables

## Concepts Learned

- Application code should not decide which environment it is running in.
- Configuration should be supplied from outside the application.
- Docker images should never contain secrets such as database credentials or API keys.
- The same Docker image can be reused across Development, Testing and Production by supplying different environment variables.
- Docker reads environment variables at runtime, not during image creation.

## Refactoring Performed

Before:

- Application decided between LOCAL_DATABASE_URL and DATABASE_URL based on FLASK_ENV.

After:

- Application only reads DATABASE_URL.
- Each deployment environment is responsible for supplying the correct DATABASE_URL.

## Architecture Improvement

Application

↓

DATABASE_URL

↓

Environment supplies the correct value

- Local Python → localhost
- Docker → host.docker.internal
- Render → Supabase

## Important Takeaway

Build once.
Configure everywhere.

Deployment should decide configuration.
Application should remain environment agnostic.

# Sprint 5 - Running Flask in Docker

## Concepts Learned

- Environment variables are supplied when a container starts, not when an image is built.
- The same Docker image can run in different environments by providing different environment variables.
- `.env.docker` allows Docker-specific configuration while keeping the normal `.env` unchanged.
- `host.docker.internal` allows a Docker container on Windows/macOS to connect to services running on the host machine.
- Docker images are immutable snapshots. After changing application code, a new image must be built.

## Architecture Improvements

- The application now depends only on `DATABASE_URL`.
- Deployment environments are responsible for supplying the correct value.
- The application no longer contains database-selection logic.

## Improvements Made

- Added `portfolio-app/` to `.dockerignore`.
- Reduced backend Docker image from approximately 1.17 GB to 254 MB.

## Important Takeaways

- Build once, configure everywhere.
- Rebuild the image whenever application code changes.
- A Docker image is a snapshot of the application at build time.


# Sprint 6 - Docker Networking

## Concepts Learned

- Every Docker container belongs to a network.
- By default Docker places containers into the bridge network.
- Every container receives its own private IP address.
- Containers should communicate using container names instead of IP addresses.
- Docker provides built-in DNS for container name resolution.
- Environment variables are injected into containers during startup.
- Port mapping allows applications inside Docker to be accessed from the host machine.

## Networking Observations

- Flask container joined the default bridge network.
- Docker assigned a private IP address to the container.
- Docker exposed Flask through port 5000.
- Docker successfully injected DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET_KEY into the running container.

## Important Takeaways

- Containers should never rely on changing IP addresses.
- Docker networking becomes much simpler when using service/container names.
- Docker Compose automatically creates networks and DNS for services.

# Sprint 7 - Docker Architecture Preparation

## Concepts Learned

- Flask-Migrate is preferred over `db.create_all()` for managing database schema changes.
- `load_dotenv()` is useful for local Python execution but is effectively bypassed when Docker injects environment variables at runtime.
- Docker Compose orchestrates multiple containers; it does not replace Dockerfiles.
- A portable development environment should containerize both the application and its database.
- Docker Compose provides automatic DNS, allowing services to communicate using service names instead of IP addresses.

## Architectural Decisions

- Continue using Flask-Migrate.
- Keep `load_dotenv()` to support non-Docker local development.
- Plan to replace `host.docker.internal` with a PostgreSQL service name (`postgres`) once Docker Compose is introduced.

## Important Takeaway

Docker Compose is an orchestration tool that brings together containers, networking, environment variables, and volumes into a reproducible development environment.

# Sprint 8 - PostgreSQL Container

## Concepts Learned

- Docker images can contain complete services such as PostgreSQL.
- PostgreSQL can be configured during first startup using environment variables.
- Docker volumes persist PostgreSQL data outside the container.
- PostgreSQL initialization happens only once when the volume is empty.
- Containers can expose internal ports to the host machine using port mapping.

## PostgreSQL Container Configuration

Container:
ppa-postgres-container

Database:
portfoliodocker

Username:
postgresdocker

Password:
RushPGDO@13

Host:
localhost

Port:
5433

Volume:
ppa-postgres-data

## Important Takeaways

- PostgreSQL server can run entirely inside Docker.
- Database files are stored inside the Docker volume, not inside the container.
- Deleting the container does not automatically delete the volume.
- Local PostgreSQL and Docker PostgreSQL can run simultaneously on different ports.

# Sprint 8.1 - Docker Volumes & PostgreSQL Persistence

## Concepts Learned

- Containers are ephemeral and expected to be disposable.
- Docker Volumes provide persistent storage independent of containers.
- PostgreSQL stores its database files inside a Docker Volume.
- Deleting a PostgreSQL container does not delete the volume.
- A recreated PostgreSQL container can reuse an existing volume and immediately regain access to existing data.

## Experiment Performed

Created:

- docker_test table

Inserted:

- Rushwanth Docker Test

Verified:

- Data existed

Deleted:

- PostgreSQL container

Recreated:

- PostgreSQL container

Verified:

- Data still existed

## Important Takeaway

Container != Data

Container can be deleted.

Volume persists.

Database survives.

# Sprint 9 - Docker Compose

## Concepts Learned

Docker Compose allows multiple containers to be managed using a single YAML configuration file.

Instead of running multiple docker run commands manually, the entire stack can be started using:

docker compose up

## Components Managed

- Flask Backend
- PostgreSQL Database
- Docker Network
- Docker Volume

## Important Concepts

### Service Discovery

Containers communicate using service names.

Example:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgresdocker:password@postgres:5432/portfoliodocker

Here "postgres" is the Docker Compose service name.

### depends_on

depends_on only controls startup order.

It does not guarantee the database is ready to accept connections.

### External Volumes

Compose can reuse an existing volume using:

external: true

This allowed reuse of:

ppa-postgres-data

without creating a new database.

## Verification Performed

- Started backend and postgres using Compose
- Verified backend started successfully
- Verified PostgreSQL started successfully
- Verified existing docker_test table still existed
- Verified volume reuse


# Sprint 10 - React Dockerization

## Current React Setup

Development Environment:
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

Production Environment:
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://rs-ppa-backend.onrender.com

Axios uses environment variables for API communication.

## Important Takeaway

Environment-specific configuration was already implemented before Dockerization, making React containerization easier and cleaner.
